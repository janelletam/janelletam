## Hello! 👋  I'm Janelle, a software engineering student and full-stack developer.
I deeply believe that when people have the time and space to work intentionally on projects that are important to them, they create beautiful and inspiring work. 

1) I found my own passion at 16 when I built Project Empathic, a BC non-profit teaching elementary school students about homelessness through empathy-building workshops. 
2) I now co-host Douze à Deux co-working sessions in Montreal to offer builders and makers a space to create. 
3) My dream is to create socially-impact software that supports outreach workers and non-profits on their mission to solve homelessness. 

🔭 What I'm currently working on:
- 🏠 Open-source software and research to support homeless shelters
- 🗺️ [HerMap](https://github.com/janelletam/HerMap), an interactive 3D map for women to share resources and stories, inspired by [Queering The Map](https://www.queeringthemap.com/)

🌱 What I've previously worked on:
- 🏦 Tinkering with a full-stack web-app @ Middle Earth Technologies to help temporary labour workers manage their finances (among some other dev ops + engineering projects) :)
- ⚡ Automations @ the Learning Buddies Network to help its IT services scale with its growth
- 🧠 A neurological testing app @ UBC SimPL & SOAR to evaluate cognitive effects of concussive injuries on athletes (at SimPL) and intimate partner violence survivors (at SOAR)

When I hear how one of my projects has impacted someone’s life, I feel empowered to innovate again and again on an even bigger scale and inspire other young people to do the same. Share similar goals or values? [Say hi](mailto:janelletam.work@gmail.com), and let's chat! 💬
