## Hello! 👋 I'm Janelle, and I deeply believe that when people have the time and space to work intentionally on projects that are important to them, they create beautiful and inspiring work. 

1) I found my own passion at 16 when I built Project Empathic, a BC non-profit teaching elementary school students about homelessness through empathy-building workshops. 
2) I now co-host Douze à Deux co-working sessions in Montreal to offer builders and makers a space to create. 
3) My dream is to create socially-impact software that supports outreach workers and non-profits on their mission to solve homelessness. 

🔭 What I'm currently working on:
- Open-source software and research to support homeless shelters
- [HerMap](https://github.com/janelletam/HerMap), an interactive 3D map for women to share resources and stories, inspired by [Queering The Map[(https://www.queeringthemap.com/)

When I hear how one of my projects has impacted someone’s life, I feel empowered to innovate again and again on an even bigger scale and inspire other young people to do the same. Share similar goals or values? Say [hi](mailto:janelletam.work@gmail.com), and let's chat! :)
